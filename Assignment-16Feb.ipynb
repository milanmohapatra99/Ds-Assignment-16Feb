    "    \n",
    "=> SQL, which stands for “Structured Query Language,” is the programming language that’s been widely used in managing data in relational database management systems (RDBMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "=> SQL databases have fixed or static or predefined schema. \n",
    "\n",
    "=> SQL databases display data in form of tables so it is known as table-based database.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> SQL databases are vertically scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> SQL databases are best suited for complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> SQL databases are not best suited for hierarchical data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Some Examples are MySQL, Oracle, Sqlite, PostgreSQL and MS-SQL etc.\n",

    "NoSQL :-\n",
    "\n",
    "=> NoSQL databases are categorized as Non-relational or distributed database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> NoSQL databases have dynamic schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> NoSQL databases display data as collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> NoSQL databases are not so good for complex queries because these are not as powerful as SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> NoSQL databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Some examples are MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDB, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDB etc."

    "e.g: ALTER TABLE Student ADD PRIMARY KEY (student_pk);\n",

    "\n",
    "e.g: TRUNCATE TABLE Student;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4- drop : A drop command is used to delete objects such as a table, index or view. A DROP statement cannot be rolled back, so once an object is destroyed, there’s no way to recover it.\n",
